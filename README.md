# m2sharp
Modula-2 to C# Translator and Compiler

M2Sharp is a multi-dialect Modula-2 to C# translator and via-C# compiler. It supports the dialects described in the 3rd and 4th editions of Niklaus Wirth's book "Programming in Modula-2" (PIM) published by Springer Verlag, and an extended mode with select features from the revised language by B.Kowarsch and R.Sutcliffe "Modula-2 Revision 2010" (M2R10).

In translator mode, M2Sharp translates Modula-2 source to C# source files. In compiler mode, M2Sharp compiles Modula-2 source via C# source files to object code or executables using the host system's C# compiler.

The PIM dialects are supported to permit compilation of programming examples from Modula-2 literature since most of it is based on PIM. The extended dialect is supported to permit bootstrapping of a full implementation of M2R10 targeting the CLR.
